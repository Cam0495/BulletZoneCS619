Group 10

Week 4 progress report 

Goals for this week:
	get shaker function to work
	fix tank motion bug
	implement game constraints
	restructure classes to not have god class
	redesign UI to make look better
	fix fire button bug 

This week our group met three times on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday and a lot of work was done individually.  The shaker function does not work, we are using the most basic example of a shake listener and are stumped on how to get it to work.  We believe the problem may be in the manifest.  The tank now moves in accordance to the specification which is good.  Game constraints have not been implemented.  There simply was not enough time after we spent most of the week trying to fix other bugs.  Unfortunately we still have somewhat of a god class because our listeners won’t work therefor we have to call the move methods in the main activity.  The UI looks really good and the fire button works as well.
