Week 3 Progress Report

Our goal this week was to get the game logic implemented 100% and to fix the UI problems we have been having.  We met Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and we completed the game logic. Although our logic is implemented we have a “god class” which will have to be altered before the project is complete.
